# DWBL "Dummer Wiffleball Leauge"
### Summer 22'
Several friends and I wanted to kill time to hangout and we started playying wiffleball, all of us coming from baseball wanted to track some stats to compare. I took up the challenege to create a spreadsheet that we could track game and player stats with the ultimate goal of handing out a summer end CY Young and MVP of the leauge. The boxes I felt it needed to check included easy to approach with baseball background, thoughouh enough for analysis, and able to track player and game outcomes. I choose google sheets so I could work on the sheet from my phone at the park while we played. After a bunch of versions settled on what was the 22' file. 
### Summer 23' 
After a good season, changes i felt that needed to happen were focused on the look and how to calculate season totals. So i switched from the single game sheets to a compiled list of games.
